# Project Overview

Welcome to the wiki of the MEDIator - Data Replication System project!

Please visit the website to learn more - https://bitbucket.org/BMI/datareplicationsystem


## Setting the Environment Variables.
Set the API_KEY, MASHAPE_AUTHORIZATION, and BASE_UR as environment variables.

For example, in Linux.

    export API_KEY=your-api-key
    
    export MASHAPE_AUTHORIZATION=your-mashape-authorization
    
    export BASE_URL=services.cancerimagingarchive.net/services/v4/TCIA/query


## Building and Executing Using Apache Maven 3.x.x
Building
--------
     mvn package

It is expected to have the TCIA API_KEY set in the environment variables to build with tests.

If you do not have a TCIA API_KEY yet, please build with skipping the tests.

    mvn package -DskipTests


Executing
---------
     sh modules/repl-server/target/bin/webapp

Go to http://localhost:9090/mediator/ using your browser to access the Data Replication and Synchronization Tool.

Logging
-------
Make sure to include log4j2-test.xml into your class path to be able to configure and view the logs. Default log level is [WARN].

## Connect to An EC2 Instance
If you prefer to use an EC2 Instance to upload clinical files to S3, you may follow the below steps.

Otherwise, you may directly upload the clinical files which were downloaded to your local computer.

* Connect to the instance

$ ssh -i pradeeban.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-237-35-248.compute-1.amazonaws.com

* Make a directory and change to the directory.

$ mkdir gsoc2014

$ cd gsoc2014

* Download and extract the meta data from the online repository (link sent to email. Given below is an example).

$ nohup wget https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcgafiles/ftp_auth/distro_ftpusers/anonymous/userCreatedArchives/652ccf44-cfda-4e99-81ac-d8f4c0eca6be.tar > nohup.out &

$ tar -zxvf 652ccf44-cfda-4e99-81ac-d8f4c0eca6be.tar
